# Logistic Regression from Scratch

Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project applies Machine Learning (ML) to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical data. The model is trained using Logistic Regression which is implemented from scratch

📌 Features

✅ Preprocessing & Feature Scaling for better model performance

✅ Logistic Regression for classification

✅ Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy

✅ User-friendly Interface for predictions (Optional Flask Integration for Future) 

📂 Dataset

The model uses the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, available on Kaggle.

    🔢 Total Samples: 768
    🎯 Features: 8 medical parameters (e.g., Glucose, BMI, Insulin, Age)
    ✅ Label (Outcome): 1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic

🛠 Tech Stack

    Python, Pandas, NumPy
    Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
    Logistic Regression
    Flask (For API deployment, In-Future)

🚀 How It Works

1️⃣ Load and preprocess the dataset

2️⃣ Train the model using Logistic Regression(Classification)

3️⃣ Evaluate the model using classification metrics

4️⃣ Deploy the model for real-time diabetes predictions(In-Future)

This model helps in early diabetes detection with High accuracy.
